I am a Master's student in Applied Computational Science and Engineering at Imperial College London, with a strong foundation in mathematics and a passion for developing scientific machine learning approaches to solve complex dynamical systems problems.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of **machine learning and physics-informed modeling**, with particular emphasis on:

- **Operator Learning Approaches**: Developing novel neural network architectures that can learn operators governing physical systems
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**: Creating innovative PINN-based methods for solving nonlinear partial differential equations
- **Reduced-Order Modeling**: Advancing CAE-based reduced-order models for data assimilation applications
- **Computational Fluid Dynamics**: Applying machine learning techniques to fluid dynamics problems and turbulent flow systems
- **Environmental Modeling**: Leveraging deep learning for multi-physics atmospheric datasets and complex environmental phenomena

I am particularly interested in **data assimilation** techniques and their applications to real-world physical systems, where I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical mathematical models and practical computational implementations.

## Academic Background

**Imperial College London** (Sep 2024 - Present)  
*MSc Applied Computational Science and Engineering*  
Department of Earth Sciences and Engineering  
Expected Degree: Distinction

During my Master's studies, I have achieved outstanding academic performance with A* grades in core subjects including Computational Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Fluid Dynamics. My coursework has provided me with systematic expertise in project version control, physical dynamics systems, inversion and optimization, parallel computing, data analysis, and advanced machine learning techniques.

**Taiyuan University of Technology** (Sep 2020 - Jun 2024)  
*Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics*  
School of Mathematics  
GPA: 92/100

My undergraduate studies established a solid foundation in mathematical theory and applications. I excelled in core mathematical subjects including mathematical analysis (97/100), advanced algebra (98/100), and numerical analysis (94/100). Throughout my undergraduate career, I was consistently recognized as an Academic Outstanding Individual, demonstrating my commitment to academic excellence.

## Current Focus

I am currently conducting my MSc Independent Research Project on "Comparative Benchmarking of Reduced-Order Models for Data Assimilation Applications," where I lead a comprehensive study evaluating CAE-based reduced-order models across diverse physical systems, including computational fluid dynamics and atmospheric datasets.

Looking ahead, I am **seeking PhD opportunities** that will allow me to further advance the field of physics-informed machine learning, with a particular focus on developing innovative operator learning approaches for complex dynamical systems and environmental modeling applications.
