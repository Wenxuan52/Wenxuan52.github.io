I am a Master's student in **Applied Computational Science and Engineering** at **Imperial College London**. My research background focuses on **physics-informed modeling**, where I have worked on integrating physical constraints with neural network architectures to solve complex partial differential equations, particularly addressing challenges in nonlinear wave phenomena and dispersive systems.

Currently, I am leading my MSc Independent Research Project on **"Comparative Benchmarking of Reduced-Order Models for Data Assimilation Applications"**, systematically evaluating CAE-based models across computational fluid dynamics, Kolmogorov flow systems, and multi-physics atmospheric datasets.

## Research Vision

I want to pursue research that bridges the gap between **theoretical understanding** and **real-world impact**. I believe that by combining physical insights with modern machine learning, we can develop more robust and trustworthy models for scientific discovery and societal benefit.

## Seeking PhD Opportunities

I am actively seeking PhD opportunities in scientific machine learning, where I can contribute to developing principled and practical approaches for modeling complex physical systems.
