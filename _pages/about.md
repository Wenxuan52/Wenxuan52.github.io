I am currently completing my MSc in **Applied Computational Science and Engineering** at **Imperial College London**, graduating with Distinction. My academic background spans **operator learning, Koopman theory, and physics-inspired machine learning**, with applications to partial differential equations, nonlinear wave phenomena, and reduced-order modeling for fluid and atmospheric systems.

I have published as **first author** in *Physical Review E* and *IJCAI 2023*, and recently co-authored *Information Shapes Koopman Representation* (under review at *ICLR 2026*). These experiences have gradually guided me toward **interpretable and trustworthy machine learning**, where I aspire to balance theoretical rigor with practical scalability.

## Research Vision

My goal is to advance **trustworthy and interpretable machine learning**. I aim to develop models that not only achieve predictive accuracy but also reveal underlying structures, provide interpretability, and support reasoning and intervention in complex systems.

## Seeking PhD Opportunities

I am actively seeking PhD opportunities in **scientific / trustworthy ML**, with the aim of developing interpretable and reliable algorithms for modeling complex systems. I aspire to push the boundaries of ML by contributing methods that are both **mathematically grounded** and impactful for **addressing key challenges**.
